# Real time end to end encrypted chat Room app
* Design a real-time chat room application that allows users to create chat rooms, join existing ones, send messages,
share images in real-time, and view active users in the room.
* AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm is used for encrypting and decrypting the messages.
* Used NodeJS as the server-side framework and integrated Socket.io for real-time communication and ReactJS for
user interface and handling user interactions.
